### Features
- Form validation (HTML5)
- Sorting
- Server stores orders
- Created function to map complex form values to object (Utils.formToObject())

### Caveats
- This probably only looks good in Chrome

### Things I would like to add (if I had more time)
- Better form validation (to support IE9 and below)
- Model validation. Right now form handles validation
- Timestamp input. Right now timestamp is hidden from the user.
- Sorting by timestamp
- Pagination 


## Test
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/test/
